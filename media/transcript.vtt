a half double crochet stitch is slightly
taller than a single crochet stitch

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
to do it you're gonna first do a yarn
over so hold your hook in front of the

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
working yarn with the tip of your hook facing you

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
do a yarn over which means bringing your

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
hook below and behind the working yarn

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
now it should look like you've got two

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
strands of yarn on the hook

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
we're going to put the hook into the

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
next hole

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
which is this one and it should look like you've got

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
four strands of yarn on the hook now

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
so your hook should still be in front of the

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
working yarn tip of the hook facing

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
you do another yarn over by bringing the

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
yarn below and behind the working yarn

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
pull that yarn through just the first

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
two loops on the hook

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
so now it should look like you have

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
three strands of yarn or three loops

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
on your hook

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
now do a yarn over again

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
bring your hook below and behind the

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
working yarn

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
and then pull that yarn through all

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
three loops on the hook

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
and that is a half double crochet stitch
